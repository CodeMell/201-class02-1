        <h1>My Understanding of Growth Mindset</h1>
        <p>Hi everyone!! I'm Kaitlyn Taylor but I go by Kat!!! (She/Her) I am a Memphian born and raised, I lived in Raleigh till I was 4 and then moved to Cordova and was raised there and have lived in the same spot ever since. I have worked in many different types of jobs and they range from criminal secretary to lifeguarding. I was a lifeguard for 7 years and started at 15. I had my first job at 12. I went to St. Ann for pre-k through 8th grade and went to St. Benedict for high school, 9th-12th. I am now apart of The Code Collective/The Code Blueprint to try to become a coder. I love anything Asian, from history to movies, from books to music, from languages to, well, everything! 🌸💮 I can't wait to travel all over Asia and possibly live and/or work there but always want to be an American! I love being creative (drawing, painting, puzzles, making things, etc), reading and watching shows, listening to all different kinds of music, playing video games, and playing/spending time with my baby: my dog Lila 🐕😍💕 I hate Math though!! I want to be friends with absolutely EVERYONE!! 😄 I love to laugh and make others laugh. It's so nice to meet everyone and I'm so excited to start this coding journey together!</p>
